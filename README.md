# Projects Overview

# 🔹 [Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction](Task_1_Titanic/titanic_logistic_regression.ipynb)
- Predicts passenger survival using **logistic regression**
- Cleaned and visualized Titanic dataset
- Evaluated model with accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report
- Evaluated with precision, recall, F1-score
- Used: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

# 🔹 [Task 2: Sales Prediction](Task_2_Sales_Prediction/sales_prediction_linear_regression.ipynb)
- Predicts sales using advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper)
- Used **simple linear regression**
- Visualized feature-target relationships and measured model performance
- Used: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`
